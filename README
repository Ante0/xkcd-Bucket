Bucket is one of the 3 bots living in the IRC channel for #xkcd.  The source
code for the bot is available here, as well as a sample database with a very
minimal config.

Note that the full database is not publicly available.

For a sample of a few of the interactions Bucket is capable of, see the XKCD
Quotes database: http://www.xkcdb.com/?search=bucket

Bucket's documentation is (poorly) maintained here:
http://wiki.xkcd.com/irc/Bucket#Docs

Any bugs, feature requests or questions should be directed to zigdon at
irc.foonetic.net.
